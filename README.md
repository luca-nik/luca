  <summary> üßóüèº My Mountaineering Adventures</summary>
  <br><br>
  Ok all this was quite boring..
  <br>
  Outside of my professional life, I am a passionate alpinist with more than 60 alpine climbs on record. 
  The mountains help me put life's problems into perspective and face them in a calm and pragmatic way.

<br><br>
Below are some photos from my climbs:
